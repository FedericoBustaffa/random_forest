\section{Experiments and Results}

Most tests done on the cluster target performance, except an initial correctness
check for both decision trees and random forest done by comparing results with
Scikit-Learn.

For random forest every version correctness is tested in order to ensure that
parallelization does not corrupt the algorithm in any way. Of course little
score discrepancies can be imputed to slightly different implementations or
hyperparameters.
