\section{Implementation}

As anticipated in the introduction, this implementation aims to speed, not good
generalization, hence in order to have a good starting point, most optimizations
are done at decision tree level.

The random forest implementation parallelizes trees in both training and
prediction phases, avoiding race conditions (almost entirely) for every parallel
version.

\subsection{Decision Tree}

Starting from decision tree implementation we have
